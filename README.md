# Okonomi

A simple finance manager built using Flutter and Hive. Built out of frustration with the current available apps.

## Current Status
This project has been on hiatus for a while due to a number of factors, most prominent is procrastination. Progress has picked up again however and I'm currently expecting it to be usable in around a month as of this README's commit date, with more testing required afterwards to iron out the bugs and maybe rework some UI elements based on feedback.

## How to Build
If you're interested in having a look but don't feel like waiting for a release, you can go ahead and clone this repo and build the app using Flutter. It's all straightforward, just make sure to run `flutter pub get` first to make sure all of the packages are up to date. Sometime's flutter does that on its own during the first build but just to be safe.
